# Jackrabbit-talk-2014

This repo contains my slides about Jackrabbit at the 64th Meeting of JSUG Vienna on May 5th 2014.

It also contains the sample application picbase that I used in the presentation, showing how Jackrabbit works.
Please note that picbase is a code sample and no full featured application.

The slides are made with reveal.js  [Check out the live demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).
